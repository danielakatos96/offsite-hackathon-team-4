    "Project Description": "Cities across the EU are facing lack of civic participation, lack of trust in public institutions and rise in populism. Investments into creative infrastructure have often fallen short of reaching the\n projected transformation impact on the local economyand its potential to increase civic engagement and wellbeing have not materialized. We have designed the Citizen Experience and Wellbeing Institute (CXI),which would use newart forms to collect data and provide evidence-based data to policy-makers.CXIwould be linked with the Urban Innovation Sphere supporting\n entrepreneurs and creative professions and the Dare to Create education component designed to foster creative education, competent &open administration and entrepreneurship. The\n solution is original and innovative because it brings the concept of citizen experience to policy-making and increases participation byproviding engaging access to data through art. It also\n provides a basis for an integrated approach to connecting culture and traditional industries for a more resilient economy. The change we want to bring to the current situation is threefold – (1)\n increase well-being of the citizens through cultural heritage and highlighting the role of citizen experience in decision-making, (2) make large employers in the region more competitive by\n establishing links with creative professions and create a pipeline of newstartups and urban innovations and (3) increase civic engagement and participation in culture.",

It invites diverse teams of programmers, data experts, designers, graphic designers and business experts to work on one of the assignments. After 48 hours, they create solutions that are presented and a panel of judges determines the winner. The capital and partners can develop the ideas (proof of concept) further with the teams and the subject matter can have a positive impact on data-driven city management and active involvement of residents in city life.  \n\nThe aim of the hackathon is to propose technical solutions that will help to address the challenges of sustainability, quality of life, transparency and information for the residents of Bratislava and the joint implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs 2030).",

    "Project Description": "Hlavným cieľom projektu CLIMATHON ALBANIA je zlepšiť̌ kvalitu života a zdravia obyvateľov Albánska prostredníctvom zavádzania inovácií na zlepšenie udržateľnosti a ochrany životného prostredia. Projekt je zameraný na odovzdávanie praktických skúseností z úspešnej implementácie niekoľkých inovačných podujatí CLIMATHON BRATISLAVA. Do podujatia sú zapojené startupy, technologické firmy, študentské tímy a skúsení mentori, ktorých je cieľom je za 48 hodín vytvoriť prototypy inovatívnych riešení, ktoré reagujú na výzvy, ktorým čelia mestá. Dvoch ročníkov CLIMATHON ALBANIA sa zúčastní viac ako 170 účastníkov, ktorí pripravia aspoň 15 inovatívnych riešení. Projekt má dva špecifické ciele (1) zlepšenie povedomia o zelených inováciách a vybudovanie kapacít v mestách na zavádzanie zelených a inovatívnych riešení (2) zavedenie inovatívnych riešení, ktoré prispejú k udržateľnosti Albánska. Projekt nadväzuje na predchádzajúce projekty, ktoré boli zamerané na podporu startupov a inovatívnych technologických firiem v Albánsku (Uplift Albania) a rozširuje cieľovú skupiny aj na pracovníkov v štátnej správe, ktorí sa musia naučiť spolupracovať s angažovanými lokálnymi inovátormi. Dôraz je kladený na zvýšenie informovanosti ohľadom inovácií, ktoré môžu zmierniť dopady klimatickej zmeny a zameranie na praktickú implementáciu inovácií v kontexte albánskych miest.",

    "Project Description": "Cities across the EUare facing lack of civic participation, lack of trust in public institutions and rise in populism. Investments into creative infrastructure have often fallen short of reaching the\n projected transformation impact on the local economyand its potential to increase civic engagement and wellbeing have not materialized. We have designed the Citizen Experience and Wellbeing Institute (CXI),which would use newart forms to collect data and provide evidence-based data to policy-makers.CXIwould be linked with the Urban Innovation Sphere supporting\n entrepreneurs and creative professions and the Dare to Create education component designed to foster creative education, competent &open administration and entrepreneurship. The\n solution is original and innovative because it brings the concept of citizen experience to policy-making and increases participation byproviding engaging access to data through art. It also\n provides a basis for an integrated approach to connecting culture and traditional industries for a more resilient economy. The change we want to bring to the current situation is threefold – (1)\n increase well-being of the citizens through cultural heritage and highlighting the role of citizen experience in decision-making, (2) make large employers in the region more competitive by\n establishing links with creative professions and create a pipeline of newstartups and urban innovations and (3) increase civic engagement and participation in culture.",

The program focuses thematically on smart city and urban innovation but is open to other areas as well. Uplift delivers value in terms of workshops and mentoring for the startups as well as visibility and network building. Mentoring and business guidance are quoted as the main benefit of joining acceleration programs by 47% of the V4 startups (Visegrad startup report). In 2018, 20 startups graduated from two Uplift batches by pitching their ideas in front of a large audience (100+) during the Demo Day. Fall batch’ demo day was preceded by Investors’ Hour, when startups met in a “speed-dating” format with 11 investors from Slovakia, Austria and Hungary. The mayor of was among the key-note speakers and two cash prizes were awarded by the international jury – one for € 5,000 and one for € 1,000. The 3rd batch of UPLIFT will take place in the Fall of 2019, enriched by the V4 aspect.",

    "Project Description": "Project main objective is to foster collaboration and innovation co-creation between cleantech startups/SMEs and large companies in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia. The expected change is that, going beyond traditional procurer-supplier relationship and addressing the obstacles that companies in both sizes traditionally have, both target groups´ strengths can be utilised to the maximum extent and as a result, more innovative products and services reach the market. Startups/SMEs will also find novel ways to collaborate among themselves, learning to go beyond purely competitive co-existence into complementary collaboration in today´s highly specialised economy. Startups and companies (both SMEs and large companies) would be supported to customise themselves, overcome the identified obstacles that they traditionally possess, and act as real innovation channels delivering the new products and services to the market. Energy plays a main role as a cross-cutting issue in all partner countries´ (as well as EU in general) RIS3s, affecting many other sectors as well as their productivity. Therefore, strengthening innovation capacities in the area of energy would bring countries and regions a long term benefit. By strengthening the clean technology providing startups/SMEs and enhancing them to cooperate and co-create with each other and large companies, it is expected that more clean technology solutions and services will be implemented in the partner countries.",
